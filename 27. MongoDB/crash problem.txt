If you leave it running then Cloud 9 could timeout and cause mongo to crash. If this happens, try the following steps to repair it.

From the command line, run:

    cd ~
    ./mongod --repair

If you're still having trouble getting it to run then find the /data directory (it should be inside of ~ or ~/workspace) and cd into it. Once inside, run rm mongod.lock then cd back into ~ and run ./mongod again (see below).

    cd ~/data
    rm mongod.lock
    cd
    ./mongod
